## The Data has been Tested on Other Models:

The brain tumor detection system was tested using various models and architectures to ensure optimal performance. Below are the models tested:

1. **Basic CNN Model**:
   - A standard CNN architecture without any normalization or regularization layers.
   - This model serves as the baseline for performance comparison.

2. **CNN Model with Normalization**:
   - Incorporates **batch normalization** in convolutional layer to improve convergence and generalization.
   - Helps in stabilizing the learning process and allows the model to use higher learning rates.
   - This model achieved better performance than the basic CNN by penalizing large weights

3. **CNN Model with Regularization**:
   - Applies **L2 regularization** to combat overfitting and ensure better generalization on unseen data.
   - This model achieved less performance than the CNN with Normalization by penalizing large weights

4. **VGGNet Model**:
   - A pre-trained **VGGNet** model fine-tuned for brain tumor classification.
   - Known for its deep architecture with 16â€“19 layers, VGGNet demonstrated average accuracy but required more computational resources.

These models were tested to find the most suitable architecture for brain tumor classification. The **EfficientNet** model ultimately outperformed all others, achieving the highest accuracy (98%) with optimal resource usage.
